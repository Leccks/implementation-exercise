# implementation-exercise
simple web application that allows you to create to-do items and folders to group them.

	default user/password = admin/admin
	PHP < 5.5.0
	Use localhost, user = "root", password=""
	I recomend to use XAMPP and put the folder of the project inside htdocs on xampp folder.
	If you are using XAMPP as i said, run it and go to you prefered browser. Once there, go to http://localhost/implementation-exercise/index.php to run the application.
	Be sure to be running MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel.
	MySQL 10.4.11-MariaDB
	HTML5
